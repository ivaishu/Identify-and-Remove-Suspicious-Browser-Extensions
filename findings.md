## Browser: Brave (Windows)

---

## Initial Extensions Found
1. **Google Docs Offline**  
   - **Developer**: Google  
   - **Permissions**: Edit, create, and view documents offline.  
   - **Risk Assessment**: ✅ Safe — official Google extension, widely used and trusted.

2. **Microsoft Power Automate**  
   - **Developer**: Microsoft  
   - **Permissions**: Enable web automation tasks.  
   - **Risk Assessment**: ✅ Safe — official Microsoft extension, necessary only if using Power Automate desktop.

---

## Actions Taken
- Both extensions are from **trusted developers**.
- No suspicious or malicious extensions found.
- **Microsoft Power Automate** was disabled since it’s not actively used, reducing potential attack surface.

---

## After Cleanup
- Extensions active: **1** (Google Docs Offline)
- Extensions disabled: **1** (Microsoft Power Automate)
- Browser security risk: Low

---

## Conclusion
The Brave browser installation is secure regarding extensions. Regular audits are still recommended, especially after installing new add-ons.
